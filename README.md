# Student_Record_Management_System
My first C Program project given by my SPL Lab faculty. It was a solo Project. This project was designed to manage and display student records and generate a result sheet based on CGPA

The Student Record Management System with Result Sheet has functionalities:
1. Add Student
2. Remove Student
3. Display Students
4. Search Student
5. Update Student
6. Generate Result sheet

Each Student has:
ID, name, age, cgpa, address and contact number.
